# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

In this module, we learned about data modeling, engineering, and analysis. Applying your knowledge of DataFrames and tabular data, you’ll create entity relationship diagrams (ERDs), import data into a database, troubleshoot common errors, and create queries that use data to answer questions. Databases are used everywhere—small and large businesses, and even individuals working on personal projects—and SQL is one of the most widely used query languages in use. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________



## Challenge Objectives
  * Use an ERD to understand relationships between SQL tables.
  * Create new tables in pgAdmin by using different joins.
  * Write basic- to intermediate-level SQL statements.
  * Export new tables to a CSV file.
  ## Challenge Summary
  * The upcoming wave of retirements poses a unique business concern that requires careful analysis, with 41,380 employees at or near retirement age. 
  * Strategic hiring to replace the employees born in 1952, that also have the longest tenure, starting in 1985, should begin first. There are currently 2499 employees that fit this and represent the employees retiring soonest. 
  * The mentorship program could represent 1549 employees that can mentor a new workforce. Phasing these employees to part-time while onboarding a new workforce would help prevent a lapse in business efficiency.
  * Mentorship program list should be crossed referenced to a table with the most tenured employees. This might help understand who should be incentivized to help in the program soonest. 
  * Also, a table that shows a descending order of salaries per department would also show the departments with those nearing retirement that represent the biggest financial impact on the organization.
